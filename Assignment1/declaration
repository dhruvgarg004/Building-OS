I have read the CSE departmentâ€™s anti-cheating policy available at https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/AntiCheatingPolicy.html. I understand that plagiarism is a severe offense. I have solved this assignment myself without indulging in any plagiarism.If my submission is found to be plagiarized from the internet, fellow students, etc.,then strict action can be taken against me.
