This project was done in course CS330 (Operating Systems) in IIT Kanpur under Prof. Debadatta Mishra.
This was done in 3 parts
I have implemented meta-data structures and functions to provide the support for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
I have implemented basic operating system calls and functions from scratch based on gemOS ( a basic Unix-like teaching OS)
I have implemented Multi level Paging and memory related system calls to enable the system to work with the large data
